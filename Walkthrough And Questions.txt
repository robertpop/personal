TASK:
Take from a previous or upcoming project some source code which provides a good example of your work and below write a walkthrough on the code.

ANSWER:
There are two files, a Controller and a Service, both written in JavaScript, part of an AngularJS project. The Controller is used by and for the page called Regional Settings, where a user can update his/her regional settings, like Currency Position, Time Zone, Week Start Day etc.
The Controller uses the Service's functions for API calls to retrieve and update data on the server.
I tried to explain more using commentaries in the code. Please see both files (Service & Controller + screenshot) for more details.

QUESTIONS:
- What problem(s) did it solve?
This part of the project solves the problem of updating / loading the necessary information from the DB, to be used as part of an AngularJS web application page. It uses AJAX API calls to communicate with the server.

- What potential issues does it have, if any?
The code could probably be written using less lines.

- How could we provide it?
This code was written based on an AngularJS front-end framework, using Laravel in the back-end for PHP APIs and MySQL DB integration. The API calls use an AngularJS REST-AJAX approach to GET or POST information to the server. The Controller & Service are written in JavaScript for AngularJS.
